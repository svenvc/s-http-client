### Features

`S-HTTP-CLIENT` can:

-   access any URL over HTTP/HTTPS using any HTTP verb
-   support connection reuse
-   support basic authentication

### Status

`S-HTTP-CLIENT` is considered stable code.

### News

-   *December 2005* - `S-HTTP-CLIENT` was featured in my first [Lisp
    Movie: Episode 1: HTTP Client and
    Server](http://homepage.mac.com/svc/LispMovies/index.html) [dead-link].
-   *November 2005* - Created as a separate project.

### Platforms

`S-HTTP-CLIENT` is written in ANSI standard Common Lisp and should be
portable across any CL implementation, provided parts of `S-SYSDEPS` are
ported.

### Installation

The `S-HTTP-CLIENT` package is loaded using
[ASDF](http://www.cliki.net/asdf). There is an excellent [tutorial on
ASDF](http://constantly.at/lisp/asdf/) to get you started.

    CL-USER 1 > (asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op :s-http-client)

Example of setting up and using ASDF to compile and load the package

### Usage

Just call `DO-HTTP-REQUEST` with the necessary arguments. For example:

    CL-USER 1 > (in-package :s-http-client)
    #<The S-HTTP-CLIENT package, 59/128 internal, 5/16 external>

    S-HTTP-CLIENT 2 > (s-http-client:do-http-request "http://homepage.mac.com/svc/s-http-client/foo.html")
    "<html>
    <head><title>Foo</title></head>
    <body>
    <h1>Foo</h1>
    <p>Just a test page.</p>
    </body>
    </html>
    "

    :NEW

In principle, any HTTP verb is allowed. It is the easiest to specify
them as keywords. In the case of :POST or :PUT, content as well as a
content-type should be specified (content length will be calculated).
Content can be specified as a string or byte sequence as far as
write-sequence can be called on your platforms TCP/IP stream. Basic
authorization is to be specified as (username . password) strings.

Connections are kept alive and reused as long as the same host and port
are accessed using the same scheme. Both HTTP/1.0 with Keep-Alive
headers as well as HTTP/1.1 is supported. Chunked transfer encoding is
also implemented.
